# 1. Two Sum

## Problem Description

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

You may assume that each input would have **exactly one solution**, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]
```

## Constraints

- 2 <= nums.length <= 10^4
- -10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
- -10^9 <= target <= 10^9
- Only one valid answer exists.

## Approach

### Brute Force (O(n²))
Check every pair of numbers to see if they sum to target.

### Hash Map (O(n))
Use a hash map to store numbers we've seen and their indices. For each number, check if (target - current_number) exists in the hash map.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(n)
